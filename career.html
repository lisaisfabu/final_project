                <p id="sen2"> People have jobs like being waiters or cashiers for resturants. 
                But now that tablets and computers have started entering resturants there is less use for cashiers 
                Also the 'contact' with waiters is lessened which creates less human interaction.
                For many years people have ordered food and talked to waiters and cashiers and created relationships.
                But now the computers or tablets are showing up in resturants which lessen human interaction, but allows room for more efficeny.</p>
                <br/>
                <p id="sen2"> The education required to install the tablets would require for you to become a electrician. Going to college would be the best way to learn about the job.
                Computer engineering is required to create the computers and tablets that are being inputed into the resturants so people can use them.
                Also if the computer or tablet were to break an electrician or computer engineer would have to come in and fix it.
                Also to create the design and code the 'app' that people are supposed to use to buy the items on the menu would require software developer.</p>
                <br/>
                <p id="sen2"> The median salary of an computer engineer :: $66,945 </p>
                <p id="sen2"> The median salary of an electrical engineer :: $64,138 </p>
                <p id="sen2"> The median salary of a software developer :: $67,779 </p>
